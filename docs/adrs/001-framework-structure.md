# 📐 ADR-001: Framework Structure and Workflow Design

**Date**: 2025-09-02
**Status**: ✅ Accepted
**Deciders**: Framework Development Team
**Technical Story**: Design systematic AI-assisted development workflow

## 🔍 Context

We needed to create a comprehensive framework for AI-assisted software development that would:
- Provide systematic approach to planning and implementation
- Integrate multiple AI models effectively
- Maintain high code quality and documentation standards
- Be adoptable by individual developers and teams
- Scale from simple features to complex systems

## ✅ Decision

We will implement an 18-step, 4-phase workflow structure:

### 📋 Phase 1: Planning & Context Setup (Steps 1-4)
- **Context Preparation**: Use `/context` command or `Explore` agent for AI consistency
- **Detailed Planning**: Comprehensive PLAN_*.md with risk assessment
- **Documentation**: ADRs and success metrics
- **Refinement**: Iterative improvement before implementation

### 🔨 Phase 2: Implementation with Quality Gates (Steps 5-10)
- **Pre-Implementation Setup**: Quality gates and hooks
- **Branch Creation**: Feature isolation strategy
- **Incremental Development**: Step-by-step with semantic commits
- **Documentation During Development**: Inline and API docs
- **Test Creation**: Comprehensive coverage (80% minimum)
- **Quality Checks**: Multi-layer validation

### 🔄 Phase 3: Review, Integration & Feedback (Steps 11-16)
- **CI/CD Integration**: Automated pipeline validation
- **Pull Request Creation**: Standardized templates
- **Multi-AI Review**: Claude + Copilot + specialized tools
- **Feedback Loop**: Structured iteration (< 3 cycles)
- **Final Validation**: Comprehensive quality gates
- **Merge & Cleanup**: Clean history maintenance

### 📊 Phase 4: Post-Merge Activities (Steps 17-18)
- **Metrics Collection**: Performance and quality data
- **Retrospective**: Continuous improvement

## 💡 Rationale

### Why 18 Steps vs Fewer?
- **Completeness**: Covers entire development lifecycle
- **Quality Gates**: Multiple validation points prevent issues
- **Systematic Approach**: Reduces cognitive load through structure
- **Measurability**: Each step has clear success criteria

### Why 4 Phases?
- **Logical Grouping**: Related activities grouped together
- **Parallel Execution**: Some steps can be parallelized within phases
- **Clear Boundaries**: Easy to understand and communicate
- **Progressive Complexity**: Simple to complex activities

### Why Multi-AI Integration?
- **Complementary Strengths**: Different models excel at different tasks
- **Cross-Validation**: Multiple perspectives catch more issues
- **Specialized Tools**: Security, performance, accessibility focus
- **Reduced Bias**: No single AI model dependency

## ⚖️ Consequences

### ✅ Positive
- **Systematic Excellence**: Every project follows proven patterns
- **Quality Consistency**: Multiple validation layers
- **Knowledge Transfer**: Standardized approach across teams
- **Continuous Improvement**: Built-in feedback loops
- **AI Optimization**: Leverages strengths of different models

### ❌ Negative
- **Initial Overhead**: More complex than ad-hoc development
- **Learning Curve**: Teams need training on framework
- **Tool Dependencies**: Requires specific AI tools and integrations
- **Process Discipline**: Success depends on following all steps

### 🛡️ Mitigation Strategies
- **Quick Reference**: Visual guides and checklists
- **Gradual Adoption**: Start with core phases, add complexity
- **Tool Flexibility**: Framework adapts to available tools
- **Training Materials**: Comprehensive documentation and examples

## 🔀 Alternatives Considered

### 1. Simpler Linear Workflow (Plan → Code → Test → Review)
**Rejected because**: Insufficient quality gates, no systematic improvement

### 2. Purely AI-Driven Development
**Rejected because**: Lacks human oversight, no systematic validation

### 3. Traditional Waterfall with AI Integration
**Rejected because**: Too rigid, doesn't leverage AI collaboration strengths

### 4. Agile with AI Augmentation
**Partially adopted**: Framework incorporates agile principles but adds AI-specific optimizations

## 📈 Implementation Details

### 🎯 Success Metrics
- Planning Phase: 15-30 minutes
- Implementation Phase: < 2 hours for small features
- Review Cycles: < 3 iterations
- Test Coverage: >= 80%
- Bug Rate: < 1 per 100 lines of code

### 🔧 Tool Requirements
- Git with semantic commits
- AI models (Claude + Copilot minimum)
- Pre-commit hooks
- CI/CD pipeline
- Documentation tools

### 🛡️ Quality Gates
- Pre-commit: Linting, formatting, basic security
- Pre-push: Full test suite, coverage check
- Pre-merge: AI review, final validation
- Post-merge: Metrics collection, retrospective
